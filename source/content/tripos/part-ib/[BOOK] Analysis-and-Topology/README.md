# IB Analysis and Topology

Notes I took for IB Analysis and Topology in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in 2024. Aimed at second-year undergraduates. Hopefully I can provide some inutition that might not be present elsewhere.

<IncompleteMessage/>

PLEASE NOTE: This book is still just a skeleton for now. If this upsets you, then <DiscreetLink href="https://admonymous.co/chen"> tell me to get my act together</DiscreetLink>.

## Course Prerequisites

Surprisingly not much! Familiarity with mathematical symbols (e.g. <DiscreetLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols">here</DiscreetLink>). Basic set theory, for example definition and results regarding function preimage (e.g. preimage of union is union of preimages). Proofs of theorems from <ProminentLink href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/introduction-to-cambridge-ia-analysis-i-2014/">IA Analysis I</ProminentLink> are good to know but not needed; the theorem statements themselves are useful but easily googleable.

## Resources

## Conventions

The following conventions are used for the sake of brevity:

- defn = definition
- iff = if and only if
- $\subset$ means the same thing as $\subseteq$ (i.e. "is a subset of, could be equal to")

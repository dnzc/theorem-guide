# All about Convolutions

Whenever people ask me "so what IS a convolution?" I get excited because there's so much to say! But then the conversations usually go something like

<div class='w-full flex justify-center pt-4'>
    <AUTOSVG src='convolutions/comic.svg' width='400' height='400'/>
</div>

And then I think "oh man, if only I had $10^{10}$ hours to explain all this, then I could blow their minds :("

Well, this is my attempt at those $10^{10}$ hours.

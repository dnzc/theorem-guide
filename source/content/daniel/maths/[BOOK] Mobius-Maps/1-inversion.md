# Review: Olympiad Inversion

Cast your mind back to math competitions, if you're like me

To shape the complex plane, we're going to need to have some transformations in our arsenal.

One such transformation is reflection. I'm sure you have plenty of intuition about this already - for example, it preserves lengths and angles.

Similarly, I'm sure you know what translations and rotations do.

There's also scaling - unlike the others, it preserves angles but not lengths.

Do you remember cyclic quadrilaterals?

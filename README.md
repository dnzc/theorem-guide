# Tripos Guru

Interactive lecture notes for Cambridge Mathematical Tripos courses.

Static markdown content is in `STATIC/content`. The static-site generator is in `ssg/`.

Like how the website looks? Maybe if I get enough stars, I can consider refactoring the horrible mess of an SSG into a pip package :P

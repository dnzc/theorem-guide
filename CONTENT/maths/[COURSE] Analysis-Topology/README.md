# IB Analysis and Topology

Notes I took for IB Analysis and Topology in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in 2024. Aimed at second-year undergraduates. Hopefully I can provide some inutition that might not be present elsewhere.

## Course Prerequisites

Surprisingly not much! Familiarity with mathematical symbols (e.g. <DiscreetLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols">here</DiscreetLink>). Basic set theory, for example definition and results regarding function preimage (e.g. preimage of union is union of preimages). Proofs of theorems from <ProminentLink href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/introduction-to-cambridge-ia-analysis-i-2014/">IA Analysis I</ProminentLink> are good to know but not needed; the theorem statements themselves are useful but easily googleable.

## Glossary and Style

In definitions, the phrase that we define is highlighted like <span className="font-bold text-highlight-blue">this</span>.

Abbreviations:

- defn = definition
- iff = if and only if
- $\subset$ means the same thing as $\subseteq$ (i.e. "is a subset of, could be equal to")

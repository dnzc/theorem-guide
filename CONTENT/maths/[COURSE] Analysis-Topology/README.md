# IB Analysis and Topology

Notes I took for IB Analysis and Topology in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in 2024. I was inspired to make these notes because a lot of the lectured material was taught badly...

## Course Prerequisites

Surprisingly not much! Familiarity with mathematical symbols (e.g. <DiscreetLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols">here</DiscreetLink>). Proofs of theorems from <ProminentLink href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/introduction-to-cambridge-ia-analysis-i-2014/">IA Analysis I</ProminentLink> are good to know but not needed; the theorem statements themselves are useful but easily googleable.

## Glossary and Style

In definitions, the phrase that we define is highlighted like **this**.

Abbreviations:

- defn = definition
- iff = if and only if
- $\subset$ means the same thing as $\subseteq$

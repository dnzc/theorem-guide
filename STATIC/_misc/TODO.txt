TRIPOS-GURU

quizzes
theorem flashcards
"lightbulb" component in components/math.js - key idea
delete writeups/, move to personal blog (create blog.danielc.rocks)
add relevant tripos questions

add tag preset colors, view/group by tags
tags page - word cloud of tags? tags.tripos.guru

backlinks (figure out where to display on page? potentially: underneath toc in right sidebar, so only visible on xl
desmos embed (?)
pyodide (?)



HOMEPAGE

redo from scratch (for some reason font is slightly smaller on public site than on preview), add portfolio. dont forget metadata (inc. og-image - copy all from tripos-guru)
maybe move danielc.rocks from squarespace to cloudflare?



NEW DOMAINS

map.danielc.rocks: graph view - map of my knowledge (from tripos guru and blog), nodes represent pages, lines represent thm/lemma/prop references etc, or links? c.f. https://space.ong.ac/
revision.tripos.guru - same content but compactified thms/lemmas/defns etc (or flashcards.tripos.guru)

map.danielc.rocks: graph view - nodes represent pages, lines represent thm/lemma/prop references etc, or links? c.f. https://space.ong.ac/

revision.danielc.rocks - same content but compactified thms/lemmas/defns etc
update home description to be "full length in-depth course notes with inuition, motivation"
"the most aesthetic and in-depth cambridge maths tripos notes on the internet"

"after my fair share of browsing tripos notes online, i realized: - everything's in latex (booo, boring! I like colours and diagrams!) - people's explanations are so *brief*, almost like they don't care about the content and can't motivate it!"

add relevant tripos questions

backlinks (figure out where to display on page? potentially: underneath toc in right sidebar, so only visible on xl
desmos embed (?)
pyodide (?)

FAQ instead of About on home page ("how do you render maths? svgs? ") - add snippet of ssg code
coded everything myself, including quality-of-life (scrollshadow (link), copy buttons (link toastify))

COMPILE_EVERYTHING: deal with svgs (also why is home page always generated? and why is svgr so slow? (~1sec per svg))

"lightbulb" component - key idea

better home page (larger landing) - and graph view / ascii art / site data e.g. total number of articles, tag view (word cloud of tags)
different image per theme: catpuccin: space galaxy cat, gruvbox: forest, etc

add tag preset colors, view/group by tags
tags page
